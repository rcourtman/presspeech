# generate-test-audio.sh — synthesise the same set of test clips both
# backends will run against. Uses macOS's built-in `say` for the TTS
# and `afconvert` to land at 16 kHz / mono / Float32 WAV, which is
# what FluidAudio's AsrManager and parakey-mlx both want.
#
# Caveat: TTS audio is "too clean" — no real prosody, no breath, no
# overlapping noise — so the accuracy column from this run is a
# weaker signal than testing against real recordings would be. Good
# for latency comparisons, good enough for sniffing relative
# transcription quality, but not a replacement for a real test set.
# Drop your own recordings into test-audio/ and the bench will pick
# them up by filename.
